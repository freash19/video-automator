dementia_vegetables,1,1,MYTH: All vegetables are healthy at any age.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,https://app.heygen.com/create-v4/draft?template_id=a7ed9e30c32a4924aefc84ffa9938ab7&private=1,
dementia_vegetables,1,2,REALITY: These five can accelerate dementia after sixty.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,3,And the worst one? You probably ate it this morning.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,4,"Margaret was sixty-eight... sharp as a blade, ran her own accounting firm, never forgot a birthday or a client meeting.",Hiroshi,elderly woman working laptop,dementia_vegetables_p1,,elderly woman working laptop
dementia_vegetables,1,5,What happened to her?,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,6,"She read an article about superfoods for aging brains — so she started drinking green smoothies every morning... kale, spinach, cucumber, the works. Thought she was doing everything RIGHT.",Hiroshi,green smoothie pouring glass,dementia_vegetables_p1,,green smoothie pouring glass
dementia_vegetables,1,7,And?,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,8,"Five years later, at seventy-three... early onset dementia. She couldn't remember her grandchildren's names.",Hiroshi,confused elderly woman forgetting,dementia_vegetables_p1,,confused elderly woman forgetting
dementia_vegetables,1,9,That's heartbreaking.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,10,Her family was devastated. They asked me: How? She ate so healthy!,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,11,The answer is in those healthy vegetables.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,12,"In Japan, we warn seniors: avoid these five vegetables after sixty... or your memory WILL pay the price.",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,13,Today we reveal which ones — and WHY your doctor never told you this.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,14,Let's start with the most SHOCKING one.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,15,Vegetable number one: SPINACH.,Michael,fresh spinach leaves close,dementia_vegetables_p1,,fresh spinach leaves close
dementia_vegetables,1,16,"Wait, wait, wait — spinach?! Michael, that's on EVERY health list for seniors!",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,17,"I know. In America, we call it a superfood. Doctors recommend it for iron, for vitamins, for everything. But in Tokyo? Hiroshi tells elderly patients: this is brain poison after sixty.",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,18,Not an exaggeration.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,19,"Here's what's happening at the molecular level... Spinach is absolutely LOADED with oxalates — these are tiny, razor-sharp crystals. Imagine microscopic shards of glass floating in your bloodstream.",Michael,oxalate crystals microscopic medical,dementia_vegetables_p1,,oxalate crystals microscopic medical
dementia_vegetables,1,20,And those crystals... they attack the brain?,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,21,"Not directly. They bind to calcium in your blood — calcium that was supposed to reach your brain. Without calcium, your neurons can't communicate properly.",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,22,"Calcium is CRITICAL for synaptic function, yes?",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,23,Absolutely. Synapses fire using calcium signals. Block the calcium... synapses misfire... memory formation slows down... and cognitive decline accelerates like a runaway train.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,24,"You know what's fascinating? In Okinawa, where dementia rates are forty percent LOWER than the United States... spinach is almost never served to people over sixty.",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,25,Coincidence?,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,26,I stopped believing in coincidences twenty years ago.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,27,"Now, people always say to me: Just cook it! Boiling removes the oxalates, right?",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,28,Does it?,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,29,"No. This is the lie the health industry keeps spreading. Oxalates are heat-stable molecules — you can boil spinach for an HOUR, and those crystals remain completely intact.",Michael,boiling spinach pot steam,dementia_vegetables_p1,,boiling spinach pot steam
dementia_vegetables,1,30,"So whether it's raw in a salad or cooked in a soup... after sixty, it's damaging your brain.",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,31,Every. Single. Bite.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,32,Vegetable number two is even MORE controversial.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,33,Oh boy...,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,34,TOMATOES.,Hiroshi,fresh red tomatoes close,dementia_vegetables_p1,,fresh red tomatoes close
dementia_vegetables,1,35,"Hiroshi, stop right there! Tomatoes are the FOUNDATION of Mediterranean diets — and those people live to be a hundred!",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,36,True... but there's a critical difference you're missing.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,37,Which is?,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,38,"Mediterranean elders eat tomatoes COOKED, slowly simmered with olive oil, in small amounts as part of a meal. Americans? They eat raw tomatoes in massive salads, dump ketchup on everything, drink tomato juice by the gallon.",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,39,"Okay, but what's the actual HARM?",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,40,Solanine — a glycoalkaloid toxin that's concentrated in tomatoes. And here's the terrifying part: it crosses the blood-brain barrier.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,41,"Once it's IN the brain, what does it do?",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,42,"It disrupts acetylcholine production — that's the neurotransmitter responsible for memory and learning. Without acetylcholine, your brain literally can't form new memories.",Hiroshi,brain acetylcholine receptors medical,dementia_vegetables_p1,,brain acetylcholine receptors medical
dementia_vegetables,1,43,That's... that's the same mechanism as Alzheimer's drugs. They try to BOOST acetylcholine.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,44,Exactly! You're taking medications to increase it... while eating tomatoes that destroy it. It's medical insanity.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,45,"In Eastern medicine, you talk about cold dampness in the brain from tomatoes, right?",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,46,Yes... but you always want the scientific translation.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,47,I do!,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,48,"Cold dampness means tomatoes slow cerebral circulation — blood flow to the brain decreases, especially in elderly people whose circulation is already compromised.",Hiroshi,reduced blood flow brain scan,dementia_vegetables_p1,,reduced blood flow brain scan
dementia_vegetables,1,49,"Reduced perfusion... less oxygen, less glucose reaching neurons. That's a recipe for cognitive decline.",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,50,Your science just validated two thousand years of Chinese medicine.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,51,There's a study from Rush University — twenty fourteen — they tracked over fifteen hundred elderly participants for six years.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,52,What did they find?,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,53,"Those consuming high amounts of solanine vegetables — tomatoes, peppers, eggplant — showed thirty-seven percent FASTER cognitive decline compared to those who avoided them.",Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,54,Thirty-seven percent! And doctors STILL recommend tomatoes for heart health!,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,55,Because they're obsessed with lycopene — the antioxidant. But they completely ignore the solanine sitting right next to it.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,56,Classic Western reductionism... one good molecule doesn't cancel out the poison.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,57,Now... vegetable number three. This is where people will REALLY fight us.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,58,I can already feel the angry comments coming...,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,59,POTATOES.,Michael,raw potatoes rustic wood,dementia_vegetables_p1,,raw potatoes rustic wood
dementia_vegetables,1,60,"Michael, STOP! You can't attack potatoes! Mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, French fries — this is AMERICA!",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,61,And THAT is exactly why American dementia rates are skyrocketing while Japan's remain stable.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,62,Okay... I'm listening. But this better be good.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,63,Potatoes spike your blood sugar FASTER than eating pure table sugar. A baked potato has a glycemic index of ninety-five... table sugar is only sixty-five. Let that sink in.,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,64,So every time someone eats a potato...,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,65,"Their blood sugar EXPLODES. And over years of this... it causes insulin resistance, not just in the body, but specifically IN THE BRAIN.",Michael,insulin resistance brain diagram,dementia_vegetables_p1,,insulin resistance brain diagram
dementia_vegetables,1,66,"They call that type three diabetes, yes?",Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,67,Exactly. Alzheimer's disease is literally brain diabetes. Your neurons become resistant to insulin... they can't absorb glucose anymore... and they slowly STARVE to death.,Michael,starving neurons medical animation,dementia_vegetables_p1,,starving neurons medical animation
dementia_vegetables,1,68,And memory dies first.,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,69,Always. Now here's the myth that drives me CRAZY...,Michael,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
dementia_vegetables,1,70,Let me guess — sweet potatoes are fine because they're healthier?,Hiroshi,,dementia_vegetables_p1,,
