ep_sleep_diabetes,1,1,Michael,[urgent] I had a patient — fasting blood sugar 118. We changed ONE sleep habit—,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,https://app.heygen.com/create-v4/draft?template_id=c3be33cf12f44a6ba52c82d033a92ec9&private=1
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,2,Hiroshi,[thoughtful] In Japan we say: what you do three hours before bed determines your morning.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,3,Michael,[shocked] Wait — you nap for TWO HOURS?,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,4,Hiroshi,[laughs] Michael your patients eat dinner at 9 PM and wonder why their sugar is high!,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,5,Michael,[warm] Hey everyone! Dr. Michael Harris here and—,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,6,Hiroshi,[warm] —Hiroshi Saito. And Michael [mischievously] remember that patient you told me about last week? The one who thought he was doing everything right?,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,7,Michael,[sighs] David. Sixty-eight years old. Went to the gym four times a week counted carbs took his metformin... [pauses for effect] And his fasting blood sugar was still 118.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,8,Hiroshi,[curious] And what did you change?,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,9,Michael,[leaning forward] One. Sleep. Habit. [pause] He stopped falling asleep in front of the TV watching evening news. Six weeks later — fasting blood sugar 94.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,10,Hiroshi,[nodding] This is not surprising to me but I know this will surprise many viewers.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,11,Michael,Exactly. Because today we're talking about five sleep mistakes that quietly invisibly raise your type 2 diabetes risk after 60. [serious tone] And if you or someone you love is at risk — prediabetes family history extra weight — [pauses] this episode could literally change the trajectory of your health.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,12,Hiroshi,[gentle but firm] And what's important — [whispers] these mistakes are NOT obvious. This isn't sleep eight hours or avoid sugar. These are things most people don't even consider connected to diabetes.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,13,Michael,[excited] Alright let's start. Because mistake number one — [pauses dramatically] — is something millions of Americans do every single night without even thinking about it.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,14,Michael,[conversational] So mistake number one. David — that patient I mentioned — [pauses] every night same thing. Dinner at seven couch at eight thirty turns on CNN or Fox News and... [mimicking falling asleep] ...falls asleep right there. TV running until midnight.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,15,Hiroshi,[curious] And he slept like this for years?,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,16,Michael,Twenty years! [emphatic] He said Doc Harris I need background noise otherwise I can't fall asleep. And you know what? I hear this every single week.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,1,Hiroshi,Second — TWO habits that almost everyone does. And which turn this freeze into... [whispers] real danger.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,2,Michael,[confessional] And I'll admit — I made BOTH these mistakes for YEARS. Every. Single. Morning. [serious] Until I saw what happens to my patients.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,3,Hiroshi,And third... what you can do TONIGHT right before bed to make tomorrow morning SAFER. Takes less than a minute.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,4,Michael,Less than a minute could add YEARS to your life. So stay with us.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,5,Michael,Alright. Let's start with that patient I mentioned. Because his story is a textbook of how the body warns us. [whispers] If we're listening.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,6,Hiroshi,[curious] The retired accountant?,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,7,Michael,Yeah. George. Seventy-four. Comes in for a routine checkup and casually mentions — [sarcastic] Doc I've been dropping my keys more often lately. Like it's NO big deal.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,8,Hiroshi,[sighs] Always no big deal until it becomes a BIG deal.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,9,Michael,Exactly. So I ask — anything ELSE unusual? And he pauses. Then says: Two mornings ago tried to write a shopping list. Got stuck on the word MILK. Just... couldn't remember how to spell it. Sat there for three minutes.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,10,Hiroshi,[quiet] Three minutes... that's a long time.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,11,Michael,[intense] That's FOREVER. And you know what? I sent him STRAIGHT for imaging. MRI showed he'd had a mini-stroke. TIA. Transient ischemic attack. [whispers] Tiny disruption of blood flow to the brain. So small most people don't even notice.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,12,Hiroshi,[calm] But it's a warning.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,13,Michael,[excited] A LOUD warning! Study from Lancet Neurology showed — if you've had a TIA your risk of a full stroke in the first forty-eight hours jumps by EIGHTY percent.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,14,Hiroshi,[serious] So if you notice something strange in the morning — forgetting words dropping things face numbness slurred speech — don't WAIT. Call 911. Immediately.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,15,Michael,[confident] Listen. This is NOT the episode where we scare you and say good luck. [excited] We're here because we have CONCRETE proven SIMPLE things you can do. Today.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,16,Hiroshi,[warm] And I want you to understand... your body isn't broken. It's not betraying you. [whispers] It's talking to you. Every morning. We'll just teach you how to listen.,ep_1_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,3,1,Michael,[practical] And how to respond correctly. Because the difference between seven A.M. when everything's fine and seven A.M. when they're calling an ambulance... it's often just a few very SMALL decisions.,ep_1_part_3,
ep_sleep_diabetes,3,2,Hiroshi,[calm] A glass of water. Five minutes. The right sequence. [whispers] That's all.,ep_1_part_3,
ep_sleep_diabetes,3,3,Michael,[excited] So let's start with the most important question... why is morning the devil's hour?,ep_1_part_3,
ep_sleep_diabetes,1,1,Michael,[urgent] I had a patient — fasting blood sugar 118. We changed ONE sleep habit—,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,https://app.heygen.com/create-v4/draft?template_id=c3be33cf12f44a6ba52c82d033a92ec9&private=1

ep_sleep_diabetes,1,16,Michael,Twenty years! [emphatic] He said Doc Harris I need background noise otherwise I can't fall asleep. And you know what? I hear this every single week.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_1,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,1,Hiroshi,[thoughtful] In Japan there is a concept we call ma — [pauses] 間. It's... difficult to translate but it means gap or pause. [gentle] Space between things. Silence. Darkness. Our brain craves this ma for true restoration.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,2,Michael,[intrigued] Okay but let's talk biologically. What exactly happens when someone falls asleep in front of a screen?,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,3,Hiroshi,[scientific tone] Two main enemies: blue light and intermittent stimulation.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,4,Michael,[building on it] Right. Blue light suppresses melatonin — [pauses] the hormone that tells your body it's time to sleep time to restore. Without enough melatonin your deep sleep gets destroyed. And that's where blood sugar problems begin.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,5,Hiroshi,And intermittent stimulation is even worse. Your brain never fully shuts off. It's processing sounds flashes of light even when you think you're sleeping.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,6,Michael,[frustrated] And this keeps your cortisol — stress hormone — elevated all night long. And high cortisol at night? [pauses for effect] That's a DIRECT path to insulin resistance.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,7,Hiroshi,[connecting dots] And this brings us to mistake number two which... [thoughtful pause] ...actually makes the TV problem even worse.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,8,Michael,[leaning in] Oh I know where you're going with this.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,9,Hiroshi,[smiling] Irregular sleep timing.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,10,Michael,[groans] I'm guilty of this. For years.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,11,Hiroshi,[explaining] Imagine your body is an orchestra. [gestures] You have violins cellos trumpets... and a conductor. The conductor is your circadian rhythm. Your internal clock.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,12,Michael,[nodding] Suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain. Controls everything — body temperature hormone production even when your pancreas releases insulin.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,13,Hiroshi,[continuing metaphor] Exactly. But when you go to bed at 10 PM Monday midnight Tuesday 9 PM Wednesday... [gestures chaos] the conductor gets confused. The orchestra starts playing out of sync.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,14,Michael,[personal confession] And here's the thing — [vulnerable] I worked night shifts the first twenty years of my career. ER intensive care. My sleep schedule was a disaster. And it took me YEARS to recover.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,15,Hiroshi,[sympathetic] It's called social jet lag. Your body thinks you're constantly traveling across time zones even if you never leave your house.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
ep_sleep_diabetes,2,16,Michael,[serious] And the research on this is scary. [pauses] 2019 study from Harvard — [emphatic] Harvard — showed that people with irregular sleep patterns had a 23% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who went to bed at the same time every night.,ep_sleep_diabetes_part_2,
