ep_sarcopenia;1;1;Michael;Right now... your body is losing muscle. And you have ZERO idea it's happening.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;https://app.heygen.com/create-v4/draft?template_id=a108ce76c12244e8bfc63ba1fe7152d8&private=1
ep_sarcopenia;1;2;Hiroshi;Three to five percent. Every single year. After sixty.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;3;Michael;No pain. No warning. Just... quietly vanishing.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;4;Hiroshi;And most people think — that's just getting older. That's NORMAL.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;5;Michael;But here's the thing... the World Health Organization disagrees.;"NANO_BANANO: Medical infographic showing WHO disease classification. Large blue ""WHO"" logo at top center.

ep_sarcopenia;1;6;Hiroshi;A disease. Not normal aging — a DISEASE.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;7;Michael;Which means it can be fought. Slowed down... even reversed, in many cases.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;8;Hiroshi;But ONLY if you know what you're actually up against.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;9;Michael;And here's what nobody tells you — there is ONE habit... something most people over sixty do every single day... that DOUBLES how fast you lose muscle.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;10;Hiroshi;We're going to reveal exactly what it is. But not yet — first, you need to understand WHY this matters so much.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;11;Michael;Hey everyone — I'm Dr. Michael Harris, cardiologist, thirty years in practice.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;12;Hiroshi;And I'm Dr. Hiroshi Saito, preventive medicine specialist. Michael — let's get into it.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;13;Michael;Alright. So most people hear 'muscle loss after sixty' and they think: I just need to exercise more, right?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;14;Hiroshi;That's the standard advice, yes. Walk more, stay active.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;15;Michael;And I disagree with that STRONGLY. Because 'just walk more' is one of the most dangerous myths in medicine right now.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;16;Hiroshi;That's a bold claim, Michael. Walking IS beneficial — the research supports that clearly.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;17;Michael;For your HEART — absolutely. But for building muscle after sixty?;"NANO_BANANO: Cause-effect comparison infographic.

Create this in sketch style with hand-drawn linework and minimal color accents.";ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;18;Hiroshi;Hmm. I want to push back on that — but I'll hear your reasoning first.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;19;Michael;Your muscles need a SPECIFIC type of stimulus to grow. Walking simply doesn't deliver that stimulus.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;20;Hiroshi;What kind of stimulus are we talking about?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;21;Michael;Resistance. Your muscles need to be CHALLENGED — pushed beyond their normal daily load.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;22;Hiroshi;In Japan... we actually see this happen naturally. Farmers, fishermen — they carry heavy loads all day.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;23;Michael;And THAT is exactly why they maintain real strength well into their seventies and eighties.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;24;Hiroshi;So the problem isn't that Americans don't walk. It's that they don't LIFT anything.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;25;Michael;That's the core of it. But let me back up — because we need to understand what sarcopenia actually IS.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;26;Hiroshi;Sarcopenia — the word itself means 'flesh vanishing.' From the Greek.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;27;Michael;And that is EXACTLY what happens. Your muscle fibers — the actual fibers — start dying off.;"NANO_BANANO: Process diagram showing sarcopenia progression.

Create this in sketch style with hand-drawn linework and minimal color accents.";ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;28;Hiroshi;Not all at once — slowly... over many years.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;29;Michael;Right. And here's what makes it so dangerous — your BRAIN stops sending the rebuild signal as efficiently.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;30;Hiroshi;The signal actually breaks down?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;31;Michael;It weakens. Your muscles become RESISTANT to the growth signal. We call this anabolic resistance.;"NANO_BANANO: Medical infographic comparing signal reception at two ages.

ep_sarcopenia;1;32;Hiroshi;Like a lock... that gets stiffer with age.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;33;Michael;Perfect. The key — which is protein — still exists. But the lock is STIFF.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;34;Hiroshi;So you need MORE force to open it. More protein... more exercise?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;35;Michael;Both — but in the RIGHT way. And that's exactly what we're covering today.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;36;Hiroshi;But Michael... people are watching this RIGHT NOW thinking: this is just what happens when you get old. They've accepted it.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;37;Michael;And that acceptance... is exactly what's costing them their independence.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;38;Hiroshi;Independence. That's the REAL stakes here, isn't it.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;39;Michael;Think about it — what does muscle loss actually LOOK like in daily life?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;40;Hiroshi;Stairs become difficult. Carrying groceries feels heavier than it used to.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;41;Michael;Opening a jar. Getting up from a chair without pushing off. Holding a grandchild.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;42;Hiroshi;These are NOT 'aging' problems. These are MUSCLE problems.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;43;Michael;And by the time people NOTICE... they've already lost twenty to forty percent of their strength.;"NANO_BANANO: Statistical bar chart showing strength loss over time. Three horizontal bars: TOP green bar at full width labeled ""AGE SIXTY: ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BASELINE"". MIDDLE orange bar at eighty percent labeled ""AGE SIXTY-FIVE: TWENTY PERCENT LOST"".

Dark background, green-to-red progression, high contrast, 16:9 format. Create this in sketch style with hand-drawn linework and minimal color accents.";ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;44;Hiroshi;That's when people start looking for solutions — but by then... recovery is MUCH harder.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;45;Michael;Much harder. But NOT impossible. That's the key message here.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;46;Hiroshi;In Japan... we don't think of strength as something you 'lose.' We think of it as something you actively MAINTAIN.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;47;Michael;That mindset difference is HUGE. Americans wait until something breaks. Japanese maintain before it does.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;48;Hiroshi;It's like a garden. You don't wait for the plants to die — you water them every day.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;49;Michael;I love that. But let me give people a NUMBER they can hold onto — because data sticks.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;50;Hiroshi;Fair enough. Give us the number.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;51;Michael;After sixty — if you do NOTHING different — you lose three to five percent of muscle mass every single year.;"NANO_BANANO: Statistical line chart showing muscle loss trajectory. X-axis: ""AGE"" from forty to eighty. Two lines: GREEN line labeled ""WITH ACTIVE INTERVENTION"" showing gradual slow decline. RED line labeled ""DO NOTHING"" showing steep accelerating decline. Large ""3-5%"" text centered with subtitle ""ANNUAL LOSS WITHOUT ACTION."" Y-axis labeled ""MUSCLE MASS PERCENT."" Dark background, high contrast green versus red, bold labels, 16:9 format. Create this in sketch style with hand-drawn linework and minimal color accents.";ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;52;Hiroshi;And with the RIGHT approach — that number changes DRAMATICALLY.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;53;Michael;Some studies show active intervention can cut that loss by HALF... or even more.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;54;Hiroshi;Half. That's the difference between needing help getting dressed... and carrying your grandchildren.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;55;Michael;Now — let's talk about WHERE this process starts. Because it does NOT start at sixty.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;56;Hiroshi;When does it actually begin?;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;57;Michael;The decline begins around FORTY. Slowly at first... almost unnoticeable.;"NANO_BANANO: Timeline infographic showing muscle loss onset. Horizontal timeline from age thirty to eighty. Green marker at thirty labeled ""PEAK MUSCLE MASS."" Yellow warning triangle at forty labeled ""DECLINE BEGINS — SILENT.""

Create this in sketch style with hand-drawn linework and minimal color accents.";ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;58;Hiroshi;So by the time someone turns sixty... they've ALREADY been losing muscle for twenty years.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;59;Michael;Which is why PREVENTION matters more than treatment at this stage.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;60;Hiroshi;This is where I disagree with how American medicine approaches this — they wait for diagnosis.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;61;Michael;And you're right — that is a serious problem in our system.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;62;Hiroshi;In Japan... men and women start monitoring grip strength in their FORTIES. It's completely routine.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;63;Michael;Grip strength — that's actually one of the BEST early predictors of overall muscle health.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;64;Hiroshi;If your grip is weakening... your whole body is weakening. It's a window into everything.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;65;Michael;So here's what I want you to do RIGHT NOW — grab something near you. Squeeze it. Hard. Remember how that feels.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;66;Hiroshi;Because in six months... if you do nothing different... that squeeze WILL be weaker.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;67;Michael;But if you follow what we cover today — it won't be. It'll be STRONGER.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;68;Hiroshi;That's the promise we're making today. Not magic — just the right information, applied correctly.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;69;Michael;And we're starting with the BIGGEST mistake most people make — and it has nothing to do with exercise.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
ep_sarcopenia;1;70;Hiroshi;Protein. And NOT the way you've been thinking about it.;;ep_sarcopenia_p1;
