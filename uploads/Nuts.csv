ep_nuts_seniors;1;1;Michael;I had a patient, 67 years old, retired accountant named Robert, eating a handful of nuts every single day thinking he was doing everything right for his heart health.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;https://app.heygen.com/create-v4/draft?template_id=c3be33cf12f44a6ba52c82d033a92ec9&private=1;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;2;Hiroshi;That sounds like a reasonable approach. What went wrong?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;3;Michael;Three months later, his blood pressure spiked to 180 over 110. He couldn't figure out why. He was taking his medications, exercising regularly, doing everything his previous doctor told him.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;4;Hiroshi;Let me guess. Salted nuts?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;5;Michael;Worse. He was buying those big jars from Costco labeled heart healthy with pictures of happy seniors on the label. Salt, sugar, vegetable oil, everything at once. Each serving had 300 milligrams of sodium.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;6;Hiroshi;In Japan, we have a saying. Nature gives us food in its perfect form. Humans add things and ruin it.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;7;Michael;That's exactly what happened to Robert. Today we're breaking down which nuts you actually need after 60, which ones can harm you, and how to eat them properly.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;8;Hiroshi;Because not all nuts are created equal, especially for our age group when our bodies process nutrients differently.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;9;Michael;Hey everyone, Michael Harris here, cardiologist with 30 years of practice treating patients over 50.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;10;Hiroshi;And Hiroshi Saito, preventive medicine specialist from Japan where we've been studying longevity for decades.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;11;Michael;We've been arguing about nuts for weeks now. Actually, it started at a conference in San Diego.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;12;Hiroshi;Not arguing. Having a passionate discussion. You were eating dry roasted cashews from a vending machine at 10 PM.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;13;Michael;I was hungry. It was a long day of presentations.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;14;Hiroshi;That's not a snack, Michael. That's a mistake. Cashews at night, roasted in oil, covered in salt. Your cortisol was probably already elevated from stress.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;15;Michael;Fine, you made your point. Today you're going to explain your traditional Japanese way, I'll explain the Western science, and we'll figure out what actually works for real people.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;16;Hiroshi;And by the end, you'll understand why three specific nuts can literally add years to your life, while others might be quietly shortening it without you realizing.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;17;Michael;Let's start with the biggest myth that almost everyone over 60 believes. All nuts are healthy, right? Wrong.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;18;Hiroshi;That's like saying all fish is healthy. It depends on the fish, how it was caught, how it's prepared, how much mercury it contains, and how much you eat.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;19;Michael;Exactly. My patient Robert, the accountant I mentioned earlier, genuinely thought he was doing everything right for his cardiovascular health.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;20;Hiroshi;What was he eating specifically? Brand, type, preparation?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;21;Michael;Mixed nuts from Costco. You know those huge containers. Cashews, peanuts, almonds, all roasted in cottonseed oil and heavily salted. He'd buy two containers at a time.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;22;Hiroshi;How much was he consuming per day?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;23;Michael;About two large handfuls, maybe two and a half ounces. He figured if a little is good, more must be better. That's the American mentality.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;24;Hiroshi;That's roughly 400 to 500 calories and well over 1000 milligrams of sodium daily just from the nuts alone.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;25;Michael;Right. And he was already on blood pressure medication, a diuretic, and low-dose aspirin. The sodium from the nuts was completely sabotaging his treatment plan.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;26;Hiroshi;In Japan, when we eat nuts, and we don't eat them as frequently as Americans do, they're usually raw or very lightly toasted with absolutely no added salt, no oil, nothing.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;27;Michael;That's a huge difference in philosophy and outcome. Because the nuts themselves, the actual food, aren't the problem at all.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;28;Hiroshi;It's what we do to them in processing. The roasting in cheap industrial oils, the excessive salt to make them addictive, the sugar coating.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;29;Michael;So here's the first non-negotiable rule. If you're over 60, raw or dry roasted with absolutely no added salt. Check the ingredient list. It should say one ingredient.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;30;Hiroshi;And portion control matters exponentially more at our age than when we were 30 years old with faster metabolisms.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;31;Michael;Because our metabolism has slowed by 20 to 30 percent, we're typically less physically active even if we exercise, and many of us are on multiple medications that interact with high sodium or excessive fat intake.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;32;Hiroshi;Now, before we get to the good nuts, let's talk about peanuts specifically. Michael, you have strong feelings about this.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;33;Michael;I do. First, peanuts aren't actually tree nuts at all. They're legumes, which means they grow underground like beans or lentils.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;34;Hiroshi;Like soybeans or chickpeas. Botanically completely different from almonds or walnuts.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;35;Michael;Exactly. And that botanical difference matters tremendously because peanuts are significantly more likely to cause systemic inflammation in people over 60, especially those with existing inflammatory conditions.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;36;Hiroshi;Why does that inflammatory response happen?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;37;Michael;They're extremely high in omega-6 fatty acids. Now, in moderation omega-6 is fine, your body needs some. But most Americans already get way too much omega-6 from vegetable oils, processed foods, and fried foods.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;38;Hiroshi;And the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is what actually matters most for controlling inflammation in the body.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;39;Michael;Right. Ideally we want a ratio of about 4 to 1, maybe 5 to 1 at most. Most Americans are sitting at 20 to 1 or even higher.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;1;40;Hiroshi;And eating peanuts regularly makes that inflammatory ratio significantly worse, especially for seniors.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_1;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;1;Michael;They do. Plus, there's another issue most people don't know about. Peanuts are highly prone to aflatoxin contamination. That's a toxic mold that can cause serious liver damage over time.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;2;Hiroshi;Is this contamination common in the United States food supply?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;3;Michael;It's regulated by the FDA, but storage conditions matter enormously. If peanuts sit in warm, humid warehouse conditions before processing, aflatoxin grows rapidly. You can't see it, smell it, or taste it.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;4;Hiroshi;So you're saying peanuts should be completely off the table for seniors?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;5;Michael;Not completely eliminated, but they absolutely should not be your daily go-to nut. If you love peanuts, have them occasionally, maybe once a week, and buy organic which tends to have stricter standards.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;6;Hiroshi;In Japan, we rarely eat peanuts at all. We strongly prefer tree nuts. Walnuts, almonds, and occasionally hazelnuts.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;7;Michael;That's a significantly smarter choice for longevity and healthy aging. Tree nuts have much better omega-3 content, less inflammation risk, and better overall nutrient profiles.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;8;Hiroshi;So let's talk about the genuinely good ones. The top five nuts for people over 60.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;9;Michael;Number one, and this is absolutely non-negotiable in my practice, walnuts. If you only eat one nut for the rest of your life, make it walnuts.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;10;Hiroshi;Why are walnuts at the very top of your list?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;11;Michael;Highest omega-3 content of any nut on earth. And it's the plant-based form called ALA, alpha-linolenic acid, which your body converts to EPA and DHA, the same omega-3s found in fish.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;12;Hiroshi;The exact same anti-inflammatory compounds that make salmon and mackerel so beneficial.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;13;Michael;Exactly. There's a landmark study from 2020 published in Circulation that followed over 50,000 people for 20 years. Those who ate walnuts daily had a 19% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lived an average of 1.3 years longer.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;14;Hiroshi;How many walnuts should someone eat per day?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;15;Michael;Seven walnut halves. That's approximately 30 grams or one ounce. Don't exceed that unless your doctor specifically tells you to.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;16;Hiroshi;In Japan, we have a traditional practice of soaking walnuts overnight in filtered water before eating them.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;17;Michael;I've heard you mention this before. Why do you go through that extra step?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;18;Hiroshi;It removes most of the phytic acid, which is a natural compound that can significantly block the absorption of important minerals like zinc, iron, and magnesium. It also makes them much easier to digest for older stomachs.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;19;Michael;I'll be completely honest, I've never soaked my walnuts. I just eat them straight from the bag.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;20;Hiroshi;You really should try the traditional method. Soak them for at least 4 hours or overnight, drain thoroughly, then dry roast them very lightly in a pan for about 5 minutes.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;21;Michael;Does it really make that much measurable difference in outcomes?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;22;Hiroshi;For people over 60 who already have compromised digestive systems or chronic bloating issues, yes absolutely. Significantly less gas, less bloating, and better mineral uptake in blood tests.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;23;Michael;Alright, you've convinced me. I'll test it with my next batch. But even without soaking, walnuts are unquestionably the number one nut for brain health and cardiovascular health after 60.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;24;Hiroshi;Number two on the list, almonds. These are probably the most popular nut in America.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;25;Michael;Almonds are absolutely incredible for blood sugar control and diabetes prevention, which is critical for our age group.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;26;Hiroshi;Which is becoming a massive crisis for people over 60.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;27;Michael;The statistics are honestly terrifying. About 30% of Americans over 65 currently have diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Another 50% are prediabetic and don't even know it. That's 80% with blood sugar problems.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;28;Hiroshi;Those numbers shock me every time I hear them.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;29;Michael;They should shock everyone. And here's where almonds become crucial. A 2017 study in the Journal of Nutrition showed that eating almonds with a carbohydrate-rich meal reduces the post-meal blood sugar spike by 30%.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;30;Hiroshi;What's the mechanism? How do almonds accomplish that?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;31;Michael;Almonds are extremely high in magnesium and soluble fiber. Both of these slow down glucose absorption in your intestines, preventing those dangerous spikes that damage blood vessels over time.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;32;Hiroshi;How many almonds should someone eat daily?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;33;Michael;23 whole almonds. That's exactly one ounce. You can split the dose if you want, half in the morning around 10 AM, half in the afternoon around 3 PM.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;34;Hiroshi;Raw or roasted? Does it matter?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;35;Michael;Either form works perfectly fine, as long as there's absolutely no added oil, salt, or flavorings. I personally prefer raw because the vitamin E content stays higher.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;36;Hiroshi;In Japan, we often eat almonds paired with dried fruit. Very small portions of each, perfectly balanced.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;37;Michael;That's fine for occasional variety, but you need to watch the sugar content carefully in dried fruit. Dates, figs, raisins, they're all extremely high in natural sugar and can spike blood glucose.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;38;Hiroshi;True. We keep portions very small. Maybe 10 almonds with one or two small pieces of dried fruit maximum.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;39;Michael;The other major benefit of almonds that people overlook is vitamin E content. Fantastic for skin elasticity, eye health, and immune system function, all of which decline after 60.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;2;40;Hiroshi;Number three on our list, hazelnuts. These don't get nearly enough attention in America.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_2;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;1;Michael;Hazelnuts are criminally underrated in the United States. Most people only think of them in Nutella or chocolate.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;2;Hiroshi;Why do you think they're so unpopular here?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;3;Hiroshi;"But for most people over 50? <break time=""0.5s"" /> 14-16 hours is the sweet spot.";ep_if_autophagy_part_6;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;3;Michael;They're less common in stores, harder to find, and more expensive. But scientifically, they're one of the absolute best nuts for preventing brain aging and cognitive decline.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;4;Hiroshi;Because of the B vitamin content, correct?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;5;Michael;Exactly right. Hazelnuts are absolutely loaded with folate and vitamin B6. Both of these are crucial for preventing age-related cognitive decline, memory loss, and even dementia.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;6;Hiroshi;Especially critical after 60 when our natural absorption of B vitamins decreases by 30 to 40 percent.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;7;Michael;Right. And there's a fascinating study from Italy, where hazelnuts are part of the traditional Mediterranean diet, showing that daily consumption for 6 months improved memory test scores by 15% in people over 65.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;8;Hiroshi;How much should someone eat per day?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;9;Michael;About 20 whole hazelnuts, which equals one ounce. You can eat them raw, lightly roasted, or even ground into a powder and added to smoothies.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;10;Hiroshi;Do you soak hazelnuts like walnuts?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;11;Michael;I don't personally, but knowing your traditional approach, I'm sure you do.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;12;Hiroshi;I absolutely do. Same exact reason as walnuts. Much better digestion, significantly less phytic acid blocking mineral absorption.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;13;Michael;Fair enough. Hazelnuts also contain a tremendous amount of healthy monounsaturated fats, very similar to the fat profile in extra virgin olive oil.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;14;Hiroshi;Monounsaturated fats. Excellent for lowering LDL cholesterol and raising HDL.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;15;Michael;Yes. And they're remarkably rich in antioxidants, particularly vitamin E and manganese, which protect cells against oxidative damage and aging.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;16;Hiroshi;Number four on our list, pistachios. These are interesting.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;17;Michael;Pistachios are unique because they're significantly lower in calories per nut than almost any other nut available.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;18;Hiroshi;Which matters enormously for weight management after 60 when every calorie counts more.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;19;Michael;Absolutely. 49 individual pistachios equal one ounce, which is only about 160 calories. Compare that to cashews, where you only get 18 nuts for the exact same calorie count.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;20;Hiroshi;So you get much more volume, which psychologically makes you feel more satisfied.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;21;Michael;Exactly. Plus, the physical act of shelling each individual pistachio slows down your eating pace dramatically. You simply cannot mindlessly overeat them like you can with pre-shelled nuts.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;22;Hiroshi;That's actually brilliant. Mindful eating becomes automatic.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;23;Michael;Pistachios are also exceptionally high in lutein and zeaxanthin. Both of these are carotenoid antioxidants that specifically concentrate in your retina and protect against age-related eye diseases.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;24;Hiroshi;Macular degeneration is a huge concern after 60. It's one of the leading causes of blindness in seniors.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;25;Michael;It absolutely is. And clinical studies show that eating pistachios daily can measurably reduce that risk. One ounce daily for six months significantly improved macular pigment density markers.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;26;Hiroshi;Should people buy salted or unsalted pistachios?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;27;Michael;Always, always unsalted. Salted pistachios can contain up to 200 milligrams of sodium per single ounce.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;28;Hiroshi;That's almost 10% of the recommended daily sodium limit in just one small snack.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;29;Michael;Right. And if you're on any blood pressure medication whatsoever, that extra sodium becomes a serious problem.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;30;Hiroshi;In Japan, we almost never see salted pistachios in stores. They're usually completely plain or very lightly roasted with nothing added.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;31;Michael;That's the correct way to consume them. And the last one on our top five list, pecans.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;32;Hiroshi;Pecans have the highest total antioxidant content of any commonly available nut.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;33;Michael;That's absolutely true. Pecans actually rank higher than walnuts, almonds, and even antioxidant-rich foods like blueberries.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;34;Hiroshi;So why don't significantly more people eat them regularly?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;35;Michael;They're expensive, seasonally limited, and unfortunately most Americans only associate them with desserts. Pecan pie, candied pecans, pralines.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;36;Hiroshi;Which completely ruins all the health benefits by adding massive amounts of sugar and butter.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;37;Michael;Completely destroys them. What you want is raw or very lightly dry roasted pecans with absolutely nothing added. About 19 pecan halves per day is optimal.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;38;Hiroshi;What specifically do antioxidants do for people over 60?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;39;Michael;They fight oxidative stress at the cellular level, which is the primary driver of aging. They also significantly reduce chronic inflammation, protect against multiple types of cancer, and dramatically improve cardiovascular health.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;3;40;Hiroshi;Pecans are particularly rich in vitamin E and a compound called ellagic acid, correct?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_3;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;1;Michael;Yes, both are extremely powerful antioxidants. There's also compelling clinical evidence they help with cholesterol management in seniors.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;2;Hiroshi;How so?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;3;Michael;A peer-reviewed study from 2011 in the Journal of Nutrition showed that eating pecans daily for eight consecutive weeks lowered LDL cholesterol by 10% without any other dietary changes.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;4;Hiroshi;That's clinically significant reduction without requiring statin medications.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;5;Michael;It absolutely is. And critically, the study participants didn't change anything else whatsoever in their diet or exercise habits.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;6;Hiroshi;So pecans alone produced that measurable improvement.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;7;Michael;Correct. Now, let's shift gears and talk about the nuts you should definitely avoid or strictly limit after 60.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;8;Hiroshi;Starting with Brazil nuts. Michael, I know you have very strong opinions on this particular one.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;9;Michael;I do, because Brazil nuts can be genuinely dangerous if you eat too many. This isn't theoretical, I've seen the damage firsthand.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;10;Hiroshi;Because of the selenium content?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;11;Michael;Exactly. One single Brazil nut contains between 68 and 91 micrograms of selenium depending on where it was grown. The FDA's daily upper safety limit is 400 micrograms total.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;12;Hiroshi;So eating just five Brazil nuts would exceed the safe limit.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;13;Michael;Yes. And selenium toxicity, called selenosis, is extremely serious. Symptoms include hair loss, brittle fingernails, chronic fatigue, nausea, and potentially permanent nerve damage.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;14;Hiroshi;Did you actually treat a patient with selenium toxicity?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;15;Michael;I did. A woman in her early 70s named Margaret. She had read somewhere online that Brazil nuts boost thyroid function naturally.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;16;Hiroshi;So she started eating them daily without understanding the risks.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;17;Michael;Six to eight nuts every single day for three consecutive months. She came into my office complaining that her hair was falling out in clumps, she was constantly exhausted, and experiencing severe nausea.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;18;Hiroshi;And you immediately tested her selenium levels.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;19;Michael;Sky high. Over 1000 micrograms per liter in her blood. Normal reference range is 70 to 150.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;20;Hiroshi;That's alarmingly high. What was the treatment?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;21;Michael;We immediately stopped all Brazil nuts, increased her fluid intake dramatically to help flush it out, and monitored her weekly. It took six full months for her selenium levels to normalize completely.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;22;Hiroshi;So Brazil nuts aren't completely forbidden, but the dosage is absolutely critical.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;23;Michael;Exactly right. One or two Brazil nuts per week is perfectly safe and beneficial. But never daily, and never more than two in a single day under any circumstances.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;24;Hiroshi;Next on the avoid list, cashews. These are more complicated.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;25;Michael;Cashews are delicious, I'll absolutely give them that. But they're genuinely problematic for people over 60 for several reasons.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;26;Hiroshi;Why are they problematic?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;27;Michael;They're significantly lower in protein and healthy fats compared to other tree nuts. And they're substantially higher in carbohydrates, which affects blood sugar.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;28;Hiroshi;How much higher in carbs?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;29;Michael;One ounce of cashews contains 9 grams of carbohydrates. Compare that to almonds at 6 grams, or walnuts at only 4 grams.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;30;Hiroshi;That's a substantial difference for someone actively managing blood sugar or trying to prevent diabetes.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;31;Michael;Exactly. Cashews also have a significantly higher glycemic index than other nuts. They raise blood sugar faster and more dramatically.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;32;Hiroshi;So for diabetics or prediabetics, cashews really aren't an ideal choice at all.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;33;Michael;They're not the absolute worst food choice, but they're definitely not optimal. And the vast majority of cashews sold in American stores are roasted in vegetable oil and heavily salted.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;34;Hiroshi;Which adds completely unnecessary calories and sodium on top of the carbohydrate issue.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;35;Michael;Right. If you genuinely love cashews and can't give them up, limit them to a small handful maximum once or twice per week. And buy them completely raw.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;36;Hiroshi;In Japan, cashews aren't particularly popular. We primarily stick to almonds and walnuts.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;37;Michael;That's probably a significant contributing factor to why Japanese seniors have dramatically better blood sugar control than Americans.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;38;Hiroshi;Diet plays an enormous role. Small daily choices compound over decades into major health outcomes.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;39;Michael;Now let's discuss macadamia nuts. These are somewhat controversial in nutritional circles.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;4;40;Hiroshi;I know you're not particularly a fan of them.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_4;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;1;Michael;I'm not fundamentally against them, but they're extremely high in total fat. 21 grams per single ounce.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;2;Hiroshi;Is that necessarily a problem if the fat is healthy?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;3;Michael;It depends on individual circumstances. The fat is mostly monounsaturated, which is excellent. But the extreme calorie density is a significant concern for seniors actively trying to maintain healthy weight.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;4;Hiroshi;How many calories per ounce?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;5;Michael;About 200 to 220 calories. That's substantially higher than almonds at 160 or walnuts at 185.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;6;Hiroshi;So strict portion control becomes absolutely critical.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;7;Michael;Extremely critical. And macadamias are dangerously easy to overeat. They have a buttery, very mild flavor that doesn't trigger your satiety signals well.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;8;Hiroshi;In Japan, macadamia nuts are considered a luxury item. Very expensive, so people naturally eat them quite sparingly.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;9;Michael;That's actually much healthier. In the United States, they're commonly added to trail mixes, desserts, and chocolate-covered varieties.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;10;Hiroshi;Which completely defeats any potential health purpose.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;11;Michael;Exactly. If you choose to eat macadamias, stick to 10 to 12 nuts maximum. And never eat them roasted in oil or coated in chocolate or honey.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;12;Hiroshi;Fair enough. Now, let's get very practical. When exactly should you eat nuts during the day?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;13;Michael;Timing matters significantly more than most people realize.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;14;Hiroshi;Morning or evening? What's optimal?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;15;Michael;I strongly prefer morning or afternoon. Nuts are extremely calorie dense and take considerable time to digest properly.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;16;Hiroshi;So eating them late at night can potentially disrupt sleep quality.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;17;Michael;Exactly right. Your digestive system naturally slows down significantly at night. A heavy snack like nuts can cause uncomfortable bloating or acid reflux.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;18;Hiroshi;In Japan, we traditionally eat our heaviest meal at lunch. Dinner is quite light. Nuts are usually consumed as a mid-morning snack.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;19;Michael;That makes excellent physiological sense. Mid-morning is ideal because it stabilizes blood sugar perfectly between breakfast and lunch.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;20;Hiroshi;And it effectively prevents overeating at lunch.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;21;Michael;Right. A small handful of almonds or walnuts at 10 or 11 AM keeps you genuinely satisfied without causing any insulin spikes.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;22;Hiroshi;What about portion sizes? You've mentioned one ounce several times throughout this conversation.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;23;Michael;One ounce is the standard medical recommendation. But for people over 60, I sometimes suggest three-quarters of an ounce instead.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;24;Hiroshi;Why recommend less?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;25;Michael;Calorie needs decrease substantially with age. We're typically less physically active even if we exercise regularly, and our basal metabolism slows by 20 to 30 percent. It's surprisingly easy to overdo it.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;26;Hiroshi;So quality becomes more important than quantity.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;27;Michael;Exactly. Fifteen almonds instead of 23. Five walnut halves instead of seven. Still get all the benefits with fewer calories.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;28;Hiroshi;Should you mix different types of nuts together or stick to one type?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;29;Michael;Either approach works fine. Some people prefer variety and mix them, others prefer simplicity.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;30;Hiroshi;I personally rotate through different types. Walnuts on Monday, almonds on Tuesday, hazelnuts on Wednesday.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;31;Michael;That's an excellent system. You get the unique benefits of each without overdoing any single one.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;32;Hiroshi;Now, the soaking debate. You promised we would settle this once and for all.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;33;Michael;Alright, fine. I'll publicly admit that soaking probably has legitimate benefits.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;34;Hiroshi;Probably? Or definitely does?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;35;Michael;Definitely does. Soaking significantly reduces phytic acid content, which binds to essential minerals like zinc, iron, and calcium and prevents absorption.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;36;Hiroshi;And for seniors, mineral absorption is already substantially compromised by age.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;37;Michael;Right. So soaking makes excellent sense, especially if you have any digestive issues or take medications that affect nutrient absorption like proton pump inhibitors.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;38;Hiroshi;How long should you soak them?;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;39;Michael;Four hours absolute minimum, overnight is significantly better. Then drain thoroughly, rinse well, and either eat them still wet or dry roast them lightly.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;5;40;Hiroshi;I always dry roast after soaking. Gives them a much nicer texture and brings out the flavor.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_5;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;1;Michael;I'll definitely try it. But let's wrap up with the absolutely critical key takeaways.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;2;Hiroshi;First, not all nuts are nutritionally equal. Choose very wisely based on your specific health needs.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;3;Michael;Second, portion control matters exponentially more after 60. Stick to one ounce or less daily.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;4;Hiroshi;Third, always avoid salted, roasted in oil, or sugar-coated nuts. Raw or dry roasted only.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;5;Michael;Fourth, prioritize walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, and pecans for optimal health.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;6;Hiroshi;Fifth, strictly limit or avoid peanuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, and macadamias.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;7;Michael;And sixth, timing matters significantly. Mid-morning or afternoon is optimal.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
ep_nuts_seniors;6;8;Hiroshi;We'd genuinely love to hear from you. What's your favorite nut? And do you soak them? Let us know in the comments below. Until next time, take excellent care.;ep_nuts_seniors_part_6;;;;;;
