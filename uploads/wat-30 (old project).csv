dangerous_habits_after_60;1;1;Michael;Every year... almost 800,000 Americans have a stroke. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. And every 3 minutes and 14 seconds... for someone, it's their last.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;https://app.heygen.com/template/your_template_id
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;2;Hiroshi;And the risk? It DOUBLES every decade after 50.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;3;Michael;Which means if you're over 60... you need to pay attention right now.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;4;Hiroshi;Michael, I need to tell you something. You're doing three things every morning that are aging your cardiovascular system faster than smoking.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;5;Michael;What? I don't even smoke!;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;6;Hiroshi;I know. But your coffee habit? It's worse.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;7;Michael;Okay... you've got my attention. And probably scared everyone watching.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;8;Hiroshi;Good. Because today we're going to show you what 90% of Americans do wrong, and what Japanese centenarians do RIGHT. Simple habits that can cut your stroke risk by up to 40%.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;9;Michael;Even I'm changing my routine after this conversation. And I've been doing it the same way for FORTY YEARS.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;10;Hiroshi;And I want you to do something right now. Think about YOUR morning. Really think about it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;11;Michael;Yeah, how many of you watching hit snooze, jump out of bed, head straight for the coffee pot before you've even had water?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;12;Hiroshi;Write in the comments if this sounds like you. Because you're not alone. But by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to protect yourself.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;13;Michael;Thanks to these Japanese habits that Hiroshi's going to share... you can actually lower your risk. Real, practical changes that work.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;14;Hiroshi;So let's not waste time. Michael, tell them what we're covering today.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;15;Michael;Alright. Hello everyone, Doctor Michael Harris here.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;16;Hiroshi;And Hiroshi Saito. Michael, you remember our argument last week about coffee?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;17;Michael;How could I forget? You told me I was... what was it... slowly poisoning my patients?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;18;Hiroshi;I didn't say poisoning... okay, maybe I IMPLIED it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;19;Michael;Well, today we're tackling the habits that are silently increasing your stroke risk.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;20;Hiroshi;And I'm going to share what people in Japan, who live longer than almost anyone on Earth, do differently. Starting with the morning, because that's where most people are making their biggest, most DANGEROUS mistakes.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;21;Michael;Alright, let me paint a picture. And I want you watching to see if this sounds familiar. 6:30 AM. Alarm goes off. You hit snooze once, maybe twice.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;22;Hiroshi;Then what happens?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;23;Michael;You throw off the covers, swing your legs out of bed, stand up fast because you're already running late. You shuffle to the kitchen. First thing? Coffee. Strong. Black. Before you've had a single bite of food.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;24;Hiroshi;And then?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;25;Michael;Maybe a quick shower, some toast if you're lucky, and you're out the door. That was me for FORTY YEARS. Every single morning.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;26;Hiroshi;And that routine, that EXACT sequence, is creating what we call in Japan... san-aku no asa.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;27;Michael;Which means?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;28;Hiroshi;The three morning evils.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;29;Michael;That sounds... dramatic.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;30;Hiroshi;It IS dramatic. Because each one of those actions, jumping out of bed, coffee on an empty stomach, rushing, they compound. Your body after 60 cannot handle that stress anymore.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;31;Michael;Okay, let me explain what's actually happening. Because when I learned this... it terrified me. After 60, your blood pressure regulation, it's not what it used to be. There's this thing called orthostatic hypotension.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;32;Hiroshi;In simple terms?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;33;Michael;When you stand up fast, your blood pressure DROPS. Your brain doesn't get enough oxygen for a few seconds. You might feel dizzy, lightheaded.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;34;Hiroshi;And if you add coffee to that...;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;35;Michael;On an empty stomach, you're spiking your cortisol. Your stress hormone. Which tightens your blood vessels.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;36;Hiroshi;While your blood pressure is already unstable.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;37;Michael;Exactly. I had a patient, David, 67 years old. Active guy, played tennis three times a week. One morning, same routine he'd done for decades. Alarm, jump out of bed, coffee, shower.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;38;Hiroshi;What happened?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;39;Michael;He collapsed in the bathroom. Stroke. We got him to the hospital in time, but... he lost function in his left arm. Could've been prevented.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;40;Hiroshi;This is why in Japan, we teach elderly people... never rush the morning. Never. Let me tell you what I do. And what my grandmother taught me when I was young.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;41;Michael;I'm listening.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;42;Hiroshi;When I wake up, first thing, I don't move. I lie there. Eyes open. I take five slow breaths.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;43;Michael;You're serious? You just... lie there?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;44;Hiroshi;Yes. Because I'm letting my blood pressure stabilize. My body is transitioning from sleep to wake. Then, slow movements. I wiggle my toes. Rotate my ankles. Flex my fingers. I'm waking up my circulation gradually.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;45;Michael;Okay, then what?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;46;Hiroshi;After one minute, not before, I roll onto my side. I sit up slowly. I sit on the edge of the bed for 30 seconds.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;47;Michael;30 seconds of just... sitting?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;48;Hiroshi;30 seconds that could save your life.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;49;Michael;Okay, but what about coffee? Because I LOVE my coffee.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;50;Hiroshi;I love coffee too! But timing matters. In Japan, we have a saying. Mizu-ichi, shoku-ni, kohi-san.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;51;Michael;Which is?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;52;Hiroshi;Water first, food second, coffee third. When you wake up, you're dehydrated. Eight hours without water. So first, room temperature water. Not cold. 250 milliliters.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;53;Michael;Then breakfast?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;54;Hiroshi;Yes. Light breakfast. Even just rice with natto, or miso soup. Something gentle. THEN coffee. 60 to 90 minutes after waking.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;55;Michael;60 to 90 MINUTES?!;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;56;Hiroshi;Yes. By then, your cortisol has naturally peaked and started to come down. Coffee won't create that dangerous spike.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;57;Michael;So here's the thing. After Hiroshi told me all this, I was skeptical. Really skeptical.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;58;Hiroshi;But you tried it?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;59;Michael;I tried it for two weeks. The slow wake-up. Water first. Waiting for my coffee. My blood pressure, I track it, it's down 12 points in the morning. TWELVE.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;60;Hiroshi;And how do you feel?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;61;Michael;Honestly? I feel... calmer. Less jittery. And I'm not crashing at 2 PM anymore.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;62;Hiroshi;Because you're working WITH your body's natural rhythm, not against it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;63;Michael;Alright, so we've tackled the morning. But there's another habit that's even MORE dangerous.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;64;Hiroshi;And most people over 60 are doing it without even thinking about it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;65;Michael;Medications.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;66;Hiroshi;Not just taking them, but HOW you're taking them. And how many.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;67;Michael;I have patients who come in with a bag. A literal BAG of pill bottles. 8, 10, sometimes 15 different medications.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;68;Hiroshi;In Japan, we call this... kusuri-zuke. Medicine pickling.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;69;Michael;Medicine pickling?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;1;70;Hiroshi;Yes. Like pickling vegetables. You're preserving yourself in medications. And it's not always necessary. Here's what happens in America. You go to your cardiologist, they prescribe something for your heart. Then your endocrinologist adds something for diabetes. Your GP adds a statin. Maybe a sleep aid. Before you know it, you're on 10 pills.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;1;Michael;And here's the scary part. Each doctor might not know what the OTHER doctors prescribed. So nobody's looking at the WHOLE picture.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;2;Hiroshi;This is called polypharmacy. And after 60, it becomes very dangerous.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;3;Michael;I had a patient, Susan, 71. She was on 12 medications. TWELVE. She came to me because she was exhausted all the time. Couldn't think clearly. Dizzy.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;4;Hiroshi;What did you find?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;5;Michael;We did a medication review. Turns out, three of her drugs were interacting with each other. One was causing her dizziness. Another was making her tired. We cut her down to 6 medications.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;6;Hiroshi;And the result?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;7;Michael;Within two weeks... she was a different person. Energy back. Mind clear.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;8;Hiroshi;In Japan, we have a different approach. We ask... can food do this job instead? Can lifestyle changes reduce the need for this medication?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;9;Michael;Give me an example.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;10;Hiroshi;High blood pressure. In America, immediate medication. In Japan, we first try... salt reduction, walking, stress management, fermented foods like miso.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;11;Michael;And you know what? That approach WORKS. Studies show that lifestyle changes can be as effective as medication for mild to moderate high blood pressure.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;12;Hiroshi;But Michael, there's something else about medications that Americans do wrong.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;13;Michael;What's that?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;14;Hiroshi;WHEN you take them. Most people take all their pills at once. Morning, with breakfast. Done.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;15;Michael;That's... what I tell them to do. It's easier to remember.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;16;Hiroshi;Easier, yes. But not optimal. Some medications work better at certain times. Some should never be taken together.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;17;Michael;Okay, give me an example.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;18;Hiroshi;Calcium supplements. Very popular for bone health. If you take them with your thyroid medication... the calcium blocks the thyroid drug. You get NONE of the benefit.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;19;Michael;And I see this ALL the time. People don't realize.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;20;Hiroshi;Or statins for cholesterol. Some work better at night. Because your body produces most cholesterol while you sleep.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;21;Michael;So here's what I want everyone watching to do. Write down every medication you take. Not just prescriptions. Vitamins, supplements, everything.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;22;Hiroshi;Take that list to your doctor.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;23;Michael;And ask three questions. One, do I still need this? Two, is the dose still right for my age and weight? Three, what's the best time to take it?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;24;Hiroshi;And remember, more medications is not always better. Sometimes, less is more.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;25;Michael;Alright, medication habits covered. Now let's talk about something that surprises people. Eating habits.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;26;Hiroshi;Specifically... skipping meals. Oh, this is a BIG one.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;27;Michael;I see this constantly with my patients over 60. They skip breakfast. Or they skip lunch because they're not hungry. They think... I'm eating less, that's healthy, right?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;28;Hiroshi;Wrong.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;29;Michael;WRONG. Because after 60, your metabolism changes. Your muscle mass naturally decreases. And if you're not eating regularly... you're accelerating that muscle loss.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;30;Hiroshi;In Japan, we have a principle. San-shoku. Three meals. Always. Even if small portions.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;31;Michael;And there's a reason for that. When you skip meals, especially at this age, your blood sugar drops. You might feel okay for a while. But then... brain fog. Fatigue. Irritability.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;32;Hiroshi;And when you finally DO eat?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;33;Michael;You're so hungry you overeat. Your blood sugar spikes. Then crashes. It's a roller coaster.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;34;Hiroshi;And for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes, which many people over 60 have... this is VERY dangerous.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;35;Michael;I had a patient, Robert, 68. Type 2 diabetes. He was skipping breakfast every day. Thought he was being healthy. Fasting, you know, it's trendy.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;36;Hiroshi;What happened to his blood sugar?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;37;Michael;All over the place. Morning readings super high. Because when you skip breakfast, your liver dumps glucose into your blood. It thinks you're starving.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;38;Hiroshi;We convinced him to eat a small breakfast. Just some eggs, vegetables, maybe rice. Within a month, his morning glucose dropped 40 points.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;39;Michael;40 points! Just from eating breakfast.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;40;Hiroshi;Now, there is a Japanese concept that's important here. Hara hachi bu.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;41;Michael;I've heard this. What does it mean?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;42;Hiroshi;Eat until you're 80% full. Not stuffed. Not starving. 80%.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;43;Michael;That's actually brilliant. Because it takes 20 minutes for your brain to register you're full. So if you eat until you FEEL full... you've actually overeaten.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;44;Hiroshi;Exactly. In Okinawa, where people live the longest, this is a daily practice. Three meals. Hara hachi bu. Consistent eating times.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;45;Michael;So the takeaway here... don't skip meals. Eat regular, balanced meals. And stop before you're completely full.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;46;Hiroshi;Your body will thank you. Now... let's talk about sleep. Because this is where things get REALLY interesting.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;47;Michael;Sleep after 60 is... complicated.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;48;Hiroshi;Complicated is putting it mildly.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;49;Michael;Most people think... I'm getting older, I need less sleep. That's just normal.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;50;Hiroshi;That is a MYTH.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;51;Michael;Complete myth. You need the same amount of sleep at 65 as you did at 35. Seven to eight hours. The problem is... you're not GETTING it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;52;Hiroshi;And poor sleep after 60 is linked to what?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;53;Michael;EVERYTHING. Dementia. Heart disease. Depression. Diabetes. Falls.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;54;Hiroshi;There was a study... from the University of California, Berkeley. They found that one night of poor sleep in elderly people can increase beta-amyloid in the brain.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;55;Michael;Beta-amyloid. That's the protein linked to Alzheimer's.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;56;Hiroshi;Yes. One NIGHT. Now imagine years of poor sleep.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;57;Michael;So what are people doing wrong? Number one... they accept poor sleep as normal. They don't address it.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;58;Hiroshi;And number two?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;59;Michael;Sleeping pills. Americans love sleeping pills. But those medications, especially for older adults... they increase fall risk. Cognitive impairment. Dependency.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;60;Hiroshi;In Japan, we approach sleep differently. We create... rituals.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;61;Michael;Rituals? Like what?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;62;Hiroshi;Evening bath. In Japan, we call it ofuro. Not a quick shower. A proper bath. 40 degrees Celsius. 20 minutes. This raises your body temperature. Then when you get out, your temperature drops. This signals your body... time to sleep.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;63;Michael;That's actually backed by science. The temperature drop triggers melatonin release.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;64;Hiroshi;Yes. Also, we turn off screens 90 minutes before bed. No TV. No phone. We might read, but with soft light. We prepare the mind for sleep.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;65;Michael;And the room temperature?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;66;Hiroshi;Cool. 18 to 20 degrees Celsius. Dark. Very dark. And quiet.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;67;Michael;I tell my patients the same thing. Your bedroom should be a cave. Cool, dark, quiet.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;68;Hiroshi;There's one more thing. Daytime naps.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;69;Michael;Oh boy, here we go. Americans feel GUILTY about napping.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;2;70;Hiroshi;In Japan, we embrace it. We call it inemuri. It's culturally accepted. Even respected. But there's a right way and a wrong way to nap. Short naps. 20 to 30 minutes. Early afternoon. Before 3 PM. Any later, and you'll mess up your nighttime sleep.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;1;Michael;Studies show that short naps can improve memory, reduce stress, even lower heart disease risk. But long naps, over an hour... those are linked to health problems.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;2;Hiroshi;So if you need to nap... nap! But keep it short. Set an alarm.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;3;Michael;Alright, last major habit we need to cover. And this one... people are going to be surprised.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;4;Hiroshi;Overexercising.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;5;Michael;YES. The habit of pushing yourself too hard. Now, before anyone panics... exercise is GOOD. Essential.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;6;Hiroshi;But there's this mindset, especially among active seniors...;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;7;Michael;More is better. No pain, no gain.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;8;Hiroshi;And after 60... that's DANGEROUS.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;9;Michael;I have patients who used to run marathons. Now they're 65, 70. And they're STILL trying to run marathons. Or they're in the gym every single day. Two hour workouts. High intensity.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;10;Hiroshi;What happens to them?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;11;Michael;They come to me with chronic injuries. Stress fractures. Joint pain. Exhaustion. And they feel GUILTY if they take a rest day.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;12;Hiroshi;This is very different from Japan. We have a concept... ma.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;13;Michael;What's ma?;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;14;Hiroshi;Ma means... space. Pause. The gap between things. In music, it's the silence between notes. In movement, it's the rest between activities. Without ma, there is no rhythm. No balance. Just noise and chaos.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;15;Michael;That's... actually beautiful. And it makes sense. Your body NEEDS recovery time. Especially after 60.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;16;Hiroshi;In Japan, elderly people walk. They do gentle tai chi. Gardening. Swimming. Activities that are consistent but not punishing.;Dangerous Habits After 60 + Japanese Longevity Secrets;
dangerous_habits_after_60;3;17;Michael;And you know what the research shows? Moderate, consistent exercise is MORE beneficial for longevity than intense, sporadic training.
